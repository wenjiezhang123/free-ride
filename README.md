# free-ride

CSCE 606 Course Project, a help offering platform

using ruby version >= 2.4

## installation

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```
the instruction above is incomplete, but is enough for you to develop the rails part.

the front-end side needs a bit more configuration

the front-end uses `webpacker` to manage modules

and uses framework `vuejs`

## Notes
right now, the integration of front-end framewrok has not completed yet.

so this branch is a backup plan for now.
